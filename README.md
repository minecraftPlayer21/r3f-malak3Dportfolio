# r3f-malak3Dportfolio
 

Welcome to the repository for my **3D Portfolio** built with **React Three Fiber (R3F)**! This project showcases my journey as a frontend developer and 3D enthusiast, blending interactive web experiences with immersive 3D visuals.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This portfolio is a culmination of my skills in:
- **3D Modeling:** Designed and textured 3D models in **Blender**.
- **Web Integration:** Exported models as **GLB** and **LTF** files, seamlessly integrating them into the web using **React Three Fiber**.
- **Animations:** Leveraged the **GSAP library** for smooth animations, transitions, and hover effects, ensuring dynamic user engagement.
- **Performance Optimization:** Compressed 3D assets, utilized lazy loading, and optimized model file sizes for faster loading times.
- **Dynamic Content Management:** Used **PHP** and **MySQL** for backend integration, enabling real-time updates for projects and content.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured a seamless experience across devices and browsers.
